Field,Description
Algebra,"The branch of mathematics in which letters and symbols are used to represent numbers and quantities in formulae and equations."
Geometry,"The branch of mathematics concerned with the properties and relations of points, lines, surfaces, solids, and higher dimensional analogs."
Calculus,"The mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations."
Statistics,"The study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data."
Number Theory,"The branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions."
Topology,"The branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, crumpling, and bending, but not tearing or gluing."
Probability,"The measure of the likelihood that an event will occur."
Differential Equations,"A type of equation that describes the relationship between a function and its derivatives."
Linear Algebra,"The branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear mappings between such spaces."
Game Theory,"The study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers."
